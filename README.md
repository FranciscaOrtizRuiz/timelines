#### TIMELINES REPOSITORY

Repository created by Francisca Ortiz

I had worked into the understanding of life histories for a while. Until now, I always manage to draw the timelines using other tools. However, currently, I am particularly interested in the way of visualized those timelines using R—the reason why I create this repository. 

In this repository, I will give examples that I found useful to visualize timelines for social sciences researchers. Hopefully, it will be helpful for someone else too.
