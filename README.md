#### TIMELINES REPOSITORY

Repository created by Francisca Ortiz

I had worked into the understanding of life histories for a while. Until now, I always manage to draw the timelines using other tools. However, currently, I am particularly interested in the way of visualized those timelines using R—the reason why I create this repository. All the timelines presented here are collected by me, however I did not created them. 

In this repository, I will give examples that I found useful to visualize timelines for social sciences researchers. Hopefully, it will be helpful for someone else too. 

Some articule where I participated, about the life history approach and the use of the biographical approach from social science:
  - Moyano, C. & Ortiz, F. (2016). Los estudios biográficos en las Ciencias Sociales del Chile reciente: hacia la consolidación del enfoque. Psicoperspectivas, 15(1): 17-29. (In spanish)
  - Moyano, Camila & Ortiz, Francisca (2018). Subjects analyzing subjects in the biographical approach: a generational study of Chilean musicians. Contemporary Social Science, 1-12.
